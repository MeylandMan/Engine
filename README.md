# SuperEngine
## Created by M.Meyland

Super Engine is a simple engine created by me to help me understand graphics world and openGL better.
This is an open-source project. So you can fork it or download it if you want. Although, I don't 
collaborate on this project. I want to learn new things by my own experience.
