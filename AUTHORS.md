# Primitive Box authors

Primitive Box is the game engine of EVA STUDIO developped by the game engineers of the team.

The game engine is taking a little bit of the same code as Godot Engine, so some of the code
are not made by us (indeed we didn't copy and paste, but we kept the logic of the code).
